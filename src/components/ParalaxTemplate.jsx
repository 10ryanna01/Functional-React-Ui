            One of the main criticisms of Internet Explorer is that it has had a
            history of security vulnerabilities and has been prone to attacks by
            hackers. This is partly due to its outdated architecture and lack of
            modern security features that are available in other browsers.

          <p className="UI__paralax__content-copy">
            {" "}
            Another issue with Internet Explorer is its lack of support for
            modern web standards. This means that some websites may not display
            properly or function correctly when accessed using Internet
            Explorer.

            Front-end technologies are tools and frameworks that are used to
            create the user interface and experience of a website or
            application. The coolest front-end technology is subjective and
            depends on personal preferences, the project requirements, and the
            latest trends in the industry.
